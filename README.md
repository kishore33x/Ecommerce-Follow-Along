# Ecommerce-Follow-Along


## Project Description

Ecommerce-Follow-Along is a guided project designed to help developers build a full-stack e-commerce web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This project covers essential features such as user authentication, product management, order handling, and RESTful API development.  

By following along, you will gain hands-on experience in designing database schemas, implementing API endpoints, and creating a responsive frontend interface.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

### What We Covered:
1. **Introduction to the MERN Stack**  
   - Understanding how MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js work together.
   
2. **Project Setup & Structure**  
   - Setting up a new GitHub repository.  
   - Initializing the project with 'package.json' and installing dependencies.  
   - Structuring the project into 'client' (React) and 'server' (Express) directories.  

3. **Core Features Overview**  
   - **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration using JWT.  
   - **Product Management:** CRUD operations with filtering and sorting.  
   - **Order Handling:** Allowing users to place and manage orders.  
   - **REST API Development:** Implementing API endpoints for managing products, users, and orders.  
   - **Frontend UI:** Building a responsive interface using React.  

Next Steps:  
- Set up the database connection with MongoDB.  
- Implement JWT-based authentication.  
- Develop initial API endpoints for users and products.


### Milestone 2 : Project Setup and Login Page
Created a structured folder hierarchy for the project.
Set up a React app for the frontend.
Set up a Node.js server for the backend.
Configured Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling.
Added optional extensions for improving development efficiency.
Built a functional and styled Login Page for the frontend.

### Milestone 3 :

Set up dedicated folders for organizing backend code effectively.
Initialized and configured a Node.js server to handle API requests.
Connected the application to MongoDB to store and manage data.
Implemented basic error handling to ensure smooth serverÂ operation.



### Milestone 4 :
 created a User Model to define how user data is structured in the database  also developed a User Controller to manage user interactions, like adding or retrieving data. Additionally, configured Multer to handle file uploads, allowing users to store files such as images.
